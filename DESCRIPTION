Title: R Access To Mass-Spec data
Version: 0.3.0
Author: William Kumler
Maintainer: William Kumler <wkumler@uw.edu>
Description: R access to mass-spectrometry (MS) data. While many packages exist
  to process mass-spectrometry data, many of these make it difficult to access
  the underlying m/z, intensity, and retention time of the files themselves.
  This package is designed to facilitate rapid access in a tidy fashion to MS
  data and trusts the user to analyze/plot/visualize it.
